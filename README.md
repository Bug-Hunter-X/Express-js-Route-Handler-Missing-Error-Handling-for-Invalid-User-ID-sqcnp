# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the provided code attempts to access a user based on a dynamically-provided ID. However, it fails to validate that ID as a number before attempting to parse it, resulting in potential crashes or unexpected behavior if the ID is not a valid integer.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, and the `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling and input validation.
